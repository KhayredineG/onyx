Act as a Principal Software Architect and UI/UX Designer. I need to build "Onyx," a premium prompt engineering utility.

The application must be **multi-user ready** and **deployable**, but maintain a minimalist, low-maintenance architecture.

### 1. The Tech Stack (Modern & Bun Optimized)
- **Runtime:** Bun (strictly used for all package management and scripts).
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router).
- **Language:** TypeScript.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a "Swiss Style" design system.
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui (based on Radix UI for accessibility) + Lucide Icons.
- **Animations:** Framer Motion (for complex transitions and the "Time Travel" visual).
- **Database (The Critical Change):** 
  - Use **Drizzle ORM** connected to **Turso (LibSQL)**. 
  - *Reasoning:* This allows us to use SQLite syntax (simple) but hosted in the cloud (deployable/multi-user) without managing a VPS or Docker container.
- **State Management:** Zustand.

### 2. The "Onyx" Aesthetic & Design
- **Swiss Style:** Rigid grid systems, heavy use of negative space, highly legible typography (Inter/Helvetica), and asymmetric layouts.
- **Onyx Theme:** Predominantly black (`#0a0a0a`), dark grays, and silver accents. No shadows; use borders and distinct layering.
- **Atmosphere:** The app should feel like a piece of high-end tactical equipment.

### 3. Core Features

**A. Airlock Security (Shared Auth)**
- Since this is for a small group, implement a simple "Access Key" system.
- **Behavior:** The app landing page is locked. The user enters a passcode (validated against an environment variable). 
- **Animation:** Upon success, the screen splits or slides open (Airlock effect) to reveal the dashboard.
- *Note:* Use a secure HTTP-only cookie to keep the session alive.

**B. Prompt Management (The Dashboard)**
- A responsive grid of prompt cards.
- **CRUD:** Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- **Editor:** A distraction-free, full-screen text editor that supports variables (e.g., `{{variable}}`).

**C. The Tagging System**
- Modern "combobox" style tagging (like Linear or Notion).
- Users can create new tags on the fly.
- Tags should be visually minimal (outlined, not filled).

**D. Time Travel (Versioning)**
- **Backend:** Every `UPDATE` on a prompt creates a new row in a `prompt_versions` table.
- **Frontend UI:** A "Timeline Scrubber" at the bottom of the editor.
- **Visuals:** As the user drags the scrubber back in time, use Framer Motion to apply a "glitch" or "blur" effect to the text area, morphing the text into the previous state.

### 4. Required Output

Please provide a step-by-step guide and code blocks for:

1.  **Bun Setup:** Commands to init the project and add dependencies (including `@libsql/client` and `drizzle-orm`).
2.  **Database Schema:** A complete `schema.ts` defining:
    - `prompts` table (id, title, content, created_at, updated_at).
    - `tags` table and a many-to-many relation (`prompts_to_tags`).
    - `prompt_versions` table (linked to prompt_id, snapshot_content, created_at).
3.  **Database Connection:** The `db.ts` file showing how to connect Drizzle to Turso using `process.env.DATABASE_URL`.
4.  **The Airlock Component:** A React component implementing the passcode logic and the opening animation.
5.  **The Time Travel Hook:** A custom React hook logic that manages fetching versions and updating the editor state when the slider moves.

Ensure the code is "copy-paste" ready and strictly follows the accessible, dark-mode "Onyx" aesthetic.
